# Form Answer Suggester Demo

A small static web app that extracts text from a copied Google Form and suggests possible answers.

⚠️ This is a **study helper** — it does not auto-submit Google Forms. Always review answers yourself.

## Usage

1. Open [index.html](./index.html) locally, or host via GitHub Pages.
2. Copy visible text from a Google Form (select all on the page, copy).
3. Paste into the textarea and click **Extract & Suggest**.
4. Review the suggested answers.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

1. Fork or upload this repo to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Source → main branch**.
3. After saving, your app will be live at `https://<username>.github.io/form-suggester/`.
